   <body background="coding2.jpg"><p id="p1"> Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at
        Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder 
        voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a California privately held company on 
        September 4, 1998, in California. Google was then reincorporated in Delaware on October 22, 2002.[12] 
        An initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its headquarters in 
        Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its 
        various interests as a conglomerate called Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's leading subsidiary and will continue to be the 
        umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page 
        who became the CEO of Alphabet.</p>
